## 1. Overview

**IGP** means **Imperfect grammar paradigm**, this is a formal name of this grammar paradigm.

This project come from my another project **AP**, **AP** is one kind of programming language, I want to try to build a compile system on my own to learn something about this area, but I was faced a lot of difficulties.

Finally I see it, I have to learn something more before I want to learn about compile system, so I come up with an idea, I'm just learning, but not doing a project, so I have many time to do it from zero.

**IGP** is a part of compile system of AP, its feature is to provide compiler with a front-axle, to do that, I tend to create a new language to describe the lexical rules and grammatical rules of another language,I call it **IGP**.
